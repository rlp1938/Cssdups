This program cssdups has been made to report duplicated style names
in a css file. Now some style names may be replicated harmlessly, eg
@font-name but others such as div.big will cause faults in the html
page display if there is more than one definition.

It is possible inhibit reporting harmless replications, see the man page
or 'cssdups -h' for the details.
