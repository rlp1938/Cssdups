This program cssdups has been made to report duplicated style names
in a css file. Now some style names may be replicated harmlessly, eg
@font-name but others such as div.big will cause faults in the html
page display if there is more than one definition.

It is possible inhibit reporting harmless replications, see the man page
or 'cssdups -h' for the details.

This program has been developed on and for Linux.
To build the program just cd into the directory Cssdups and type:
make

Note that there is no configure script provided so the step:
./configure
is neither necessary nor possible.

After the build you can install with, as root, eg su or prefix the 
command with sudo depending on your system:
make install

To finish:
make clean
That gets rid of the work files.

Finally, if you no longer need the program you, as root, remove
it and it's configuration files with:
make remove

You must be in the directory where you built the program for the above
to work.


NB Modern Linux distributions do not have the tools necessary to build 
programs when newly installed. You need to install these tools.

For Debian based systems such as Ubuntu and Mint do this:
sudo apt-get install build-essential

For Fedora:
yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
